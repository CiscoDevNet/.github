AGENTS.md is a simple, open format for guiding AI agents.

Edit the following template to provide users with a better experience when working with coding agents (VS Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.).

Provide the agent with information on which documentation and/or OpenAPI spec document to use.  
For example, you can paste a direct link to the latest OpenAPI spec. 
Direct link for Cisco Secure Access Authorization API:
https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/cloud-security-apis-in-eft/docs/secure-access/reference/auth/cisco_secure_access_token_authorization_api_2_0_0.yaml 

Add information about the MCP servers needed for the project.

You can add a link to the Cisco DevNet sandbox needed to work with the project. 
Choose the direct link from the list here: https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/DevNet

Additionally, you can provide information about the version and link to the SDK, Infrastructure as Code provider/module, etc., which is recommended for use by coding Agents.
